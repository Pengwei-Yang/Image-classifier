# Image-classifier
This is a demo machine learning project for image classification.

## Getting Started
In this project, various machine learning models such as KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, along with techniques like Grid Search and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), were applied. These models were employed in a classification task on the EMNIST dataset, and a thorough comparison of their performances was conducted.
### Prerequisites
